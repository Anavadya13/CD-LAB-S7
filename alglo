Excellent üí™ ‚Äî this is the exam-level summary question:
‚ÄúWrite the algorithmic difference between Recursive Descent Parser, Shift-Reduce Parser, and Operator Precedence Parser.‚Äù
Let‚Äôs make it short, structured, and ready to write in your exam notebook üëá

‚öôÔ∏è ALGORITHMIC DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE THREE PARSERS

üîπ 1Ô∏è‚É£ Recursive Descent Parser (Top-Down Parsing)
Algorithm:
Start with the start symbol of the grammar.


For each non-terminal, write a recursive procedure.


Read the current input token.


Based on the grammar rule and token:


If it matches a terminal ‚Üí consume the token.


If it‚Äôs a non-terminal ‚Üí call its procedure.


Continue expanding until:


The entire input is matched (‚úÖ Accept), or


No rule matches (‚ùå Reject).


Key Features:
Direction: Top-Down (Start symbol ‚Üí terminals)


Main operation: Recursive function calls


Works for: LL(1) grammars


Example: E ‚Üí T + E | T ‚Üí function E() calls T() recursively.



üîπ 2Ô∏è‚É£ Shift‚ÄìReduce Parser (Bottom-Up Parsing)
Algorithm:
Initialize stack = $ and input = string + $.


Repeat until input is accepted or rejected:


Shift: Push next input symbol to stack.


Check: If the top of the stack matches RHS of any production,
 ‚Üí Reduce it to the LHS of that production.


Continue shifting/reducing until only the start symbol remains on the stack.


If stack = $S and input = $, then Accept.
 Else, Reject.


Key Features:
Direction: Bottom-Up (terminals ‚Üí start symbol)


Main operation: Shift / Reduce using grammar rules


Works for: Most context-free grammars (LR family)


Core idea: Find handles on the stack and replace them.



üîπ 3Ô∏è‚É£ Operator Precedence Parser (Specialized Bottom-Up Parsing)
Algorithm:
Construct a precedence table between terminals using rules like <, >, and =
 (indicating shift, reduce, or equal precedence).


Initialize stack = $ and input = string + $.


Repeat:


Let a = topmost terminal in stack, b = next input symbol.


Look up relation(a, b) in the precedence table.


If < ‚Üí Shift (push next symbol from input to stack).


If > ‚Üí Reduce (replace top of stack handle with non-terminal).


If A ‚Üí Accept.


Else ‚Üí Reject.


Continue until input fully parsed and stack has only start symbol.


Key Features:
Direction: Bottom-Up


Main operation: Uses precedence relations <, > to decide shift/reduce


Works for: Operator grammars only (no Œµ-productions, no adjacent non-terminals)


Purpose: To handle operator precedence and associativity automatically.

‚úÖ Short Summary (Exam-Ready)
Recursive Descent Parser ‚Äì A top-down approach that expands non-terminals using recursive procedures. Works only for LL(1) grammars.
Shift‚ÄìReduce Parser ‚Äì A bottom-up parser that uses a stack and grammar rules to shift input symbols and reduce handles to non-terminals.
Operator Precedence Parser ‚Äì A simplified bottom-up parser that uses a precedence relation table (<, >, A) to decide shift and reduce actions for operator-based expressions.

Would you like me to give a flowchart-style pseudocode (like how to write steps in algorithm form) for each one ‚Äî the exact way it appears in lab exams?

Cal

Key Algorithm for Lex/Yacc Calculator
This algorithm outlines the core steps a Lex/Yacc-generated parser takes to evaluate mathematical expressions.
1. Initialization Phase
The main() function is executed.
It calls yyparse(), the main parser function generated by Yacc.
yyparse() takes control and begins the parsing process.
2. The Parser-Lexer Interaction (Main Loop)
The parser (yyparse) and the lexer (yylex) work in a loop:
Parser Needs Token: yyparse() (the parser) needs a token to make a decision.
Lexer Provides Token: yyparse() calls yylex() (the lexer) to get the next token from the input.
Lexer's Job (yylex):
Reads the input stream (e.g., "123 + 45").
Finds the longest-matching pattern from calc.l.
If [0-9]+ (a number): It converts the text (yytext) to an integer using atoi(), stores the value in yylval, and returns the NUMBER token to the parser.
If [ \t] (whitespace): It matches, performs no action, and looks for the next token.
If any other character (.): It returns the character itself as the token (e.g., +, *, \n).
Parser's Job (yyparse):
The parser maintains an internal stack.
It receives the token (e.g., NUMBER) and its value (e.g., 123) from the lexer.
Based on the token and its current state, it performs one of two actions:
SHIFT: Pushes the new token onto its stack. This is done when the tokens on the stack do not yet form a complete grammar rule.
REDUCE: When the top of the stack matches the right-hand side (RHS) of a grammar rule (e.g., expr '+' expr), the parser:
Pops the symbols for the RHS (expr, +, expr) off the stack.
Executes the associated C code (the "semantic action"), e.g., $$ = $1 + $3;.
Pushes the single non-terminal from the left-hand side (LHS) (e.g., expr) back onto the stack, along with its new calculated value ($$).
3. Handling Precedence and Associativity (Key Concept)
Conflict: A "shift/reduce conflict" occurs when the parser could either shift a new operator (like *) or reduce a completed expression (like 10 + 5).
Resolution: The parser uses the %left, %right, or %nonassoc declarations in calc.y to resolve this:
%left '+' '-'
%left '*' '/'
Precedence: Since * and / are declared after + and -, they have higher precedence. The parser will SHIFT the * or / onto the stack instead of reducing the + or - expression, ensuring multiplication/division happens first.
Associativity: %left means operators are evaluated from left to right (e.g., 10 - 5 + 3 is (10 - 5) + 3).
4. Semantic Actions (The Calculation)
When a reduce occurs, the C code inside {...} is executed.
$$ represents the value of the new symbol being pushed (the LHS, e.g., expr).
$1, $2, $3, etc., represent the values of the symbols being popped from the stack (the RHS, e.g., expr, +, expr).
The line $$ = $1 + $3; is what actually performs the addition, taking the value of the first expr ($1) and the second expr ($3) and assigning the result to the new expr ($$).
5. Termination
When the lexer (yylex) reaches the end of the input (Ctrl+D), it calls yywrap().
yywrap() returns 1, confirming the end.
yylex() returns a special "end-of-file" token (value 0) to the parser.
yyparse() accepts the input, cleans up its stack, and returns 0 to the main() function.
The program exits successfully.
Key Algorithm for Lex/Yacc for Loop Parser
This algorithm outlines the core steps the Lex/Yacc parser takes to validate the syntax of a C-style for loop.
1. Initialization Phase
The main() function is executed and prints "Enter a for loop:".
It calls yyparse(), the main parser function generated by Yacc.
yyparse() takes control and begins the parsing process.
2. The Parser-Lexer Interaction (Main Loop)
The parser (yyparse) and the lexer (yylex) work in a loop to read the input.
Parser Needs Token: yyparse() needs a token to determine what to do.
Lexer Provides Token: yyparse() calls yylex() to get the next token.
Lexer's Job (yylex):
Reads the input stream (e.g., for(i=0; i<10; i++)).
Finds the longest-matching pattern from for_loop.l.
Keywords: for is returned as the FOR token.
Symbols: ++ is INCR, <= is LE, ( is '(, etc.
Identifiers: i is returned as the ID token.
Numbers: 10 is returned as the NUM token.
Whitespace: [ \t\n]+ is matched and ignored.
Parser's Job (yyparse):
The parser maintains an internal stack and follows the grammar rules from for_loop.y.
SHIFT: The parser shifts tokens onto its stack as long as they build toward a valid rule.
Example: To parse for(i=0;...), it will SHIFT FOR, then (, then ID, then =.
REDUCE: When the top of the stack matches the right-hand side (RHS) of a rule, it reduces it.
Example 1: After shifting NUM (value 0), the stack top is NUM. This matches E: NUM. The parser reduces NUM to E.
Example 2: The stack top becomes ID = E. This matches E: ID '=' E. The parser reduces these three symbols to a single E.
Example 3: Eventually, the stack will look like: FOR ( E ; E ; E ) DEF. The parser reduces this to the ST (statement) rule.
3. The Core Grammar Rule
The entire parser is built to recognize one primary structure: ST: FOR '(' E ';' E ';' E ')' DEF
The parser's main goal is to successfully shift the FOR, (, ;, ;, ) tokens and successfully reduce the three sections between them into E symbols, and the part after into a DEF symbol.
4. Handling Precedence in Expressions
The E (Expression) rules use precedence to parse complex statements correctly.
Conflict: When parsing a = b + c * d, the parser has conflicts.
Resolution: The %left and %right declarations resolve this:
%left '*' '/' has the highest precedence. c * d is reduced to E first.
%left '+' '-' is next. b + E is reduced to E next.
%right '=' is last and right-associative. a = E is reduced last, meaning assignment happens after the whole right side is calculated.
5. Semantic Actions (What Happens on Reduce)
This parser is a SYNTAX VALIDATOR. Its grammar rules (like E: E '+' E) have no C code (semantic actions) attached.
Unlike the calculator, it does not calculate $$ = $1 + $3.
The parser's only job is to check if the input structurally matches the rules. If it can reduce the input all the way to S, the syntax is valid.
6. Termination
Success: If the entire input is read and successfully reduced to the start symbol S, the parser executes the only semantic action: printf("Input accepted\n") and exits.
Failure: If the parser receives a token that does not fit any rule (e.g., for(i<5 i++) - missing a semicolon), it calls yyerror().
yyerror() prints "Syntax Error: ..." and forces the program to exit(1).
